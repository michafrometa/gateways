# Gateways
Hi, this is a simple project to improve my skills with Spring Boot.
It contains my own solution for [a test](TEST.md) requested to get a job in [a software company](https://www.musala.com/).

Basically it contains: 
1: Spring MVC

2: Spring DATA JPA.

3: Testing with [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/), [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/), [OpenPojo](https://github.com/OpenPojo/openpojo)

4: Mapping with [Mapstruct](https://mapstruct.org/)

5: API Documentation with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
